# Decentralized-Polling-System


A decentralized polling system built on the Ethereum blockchain using Solidity smart contracts, React.js, and Web3.js.

## Introduction

The Decentralized Polling System is designed to allow users to create polls, participate in them, and cast votes. All data is stored on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and security.

## Features

- Create new polls
- Participate in existing polls
- Cast votes securely
- View poll results
- Blockchain-based data storage for transparency

## Technologies Used

- Solidity (for smart contracts)
- Truffle (for development and deployment of smart contracts)
- Ganache (for local Ethereum blockchain)
- Web3.js (for interacting with Ethereum blockchain)
- React.js (for front-end)
- MetaMask (for managing Ethereum accounts and transactions)


## Prerequisites

- Node.js
- Truffle
- Ganache
- MetaMask

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/decentralized-polling-system.git
    cd decentralized-polling-system
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    cd client
    npm install
    ```

3. **Compile and deploy smart contracts:**

    ```bash
    truffle compile
    truffle migrate
    ```

4. **Start the development server:**

    ```bash
    cd client
    npm start
    ```

5. **Connect MetaMask to your local Ganache blockchain.**

## Usage

- **Create Polls**: Users can create new polls.
- **Vote on Polls**: Users can vote on existing polls.
- **View Results**: Users can view the results of the polls.
