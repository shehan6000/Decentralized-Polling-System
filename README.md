# Decentralized-Polling-System


A decentralized polling system built on the Ethereum blockchain using Solidity smart contracts, React.js, and Web3.js.

## Introduction

The Decentralized Polling System is designed to allow users to create polls, participate in them, and cast votes. All data is stored on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and security.

## Features

- Create new polls
- Participate in existing polls
- Cast votes securely
- View poll results
- Blockchain-based data storage for transparency

## Technologies Used

- Solidity (for smart contracts)
- Truffle (for development and deployment of smart contracts)
- Ganache (for local Ethereum blockchain)
- Web3.js (for interacting with Ethereum blockchain)
- React.js (for front-end)
- MetaMask (for managing Ethereum accounts and transactions)
